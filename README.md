## AIM
Our main idea behind the project is to implement a block chain like structure in
a social networking chat application , which allows all the user data to stay decentralised.

## What it does
It is a chat application equipped with all the basic features and secrity standards,
where the users can securely login and chat with other users, but instead of consolidating 
all the user data over a company server, it is decentralised and stored as blocks of information over the userbase
itself using encryption techniques which use the username and password as public and 
private keys.

## How it does 
It is developed using gun.js which is based on DWeb concept which stands for decentralised
web. 

## What we learned 
We understood how the block-chain system works and how it can be implemented on a smaller scale
and the amount of versatility and depth in its usage.
